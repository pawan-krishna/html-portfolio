<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a BTech Computer Science undergraduate specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning,
 the focus is on building end‑to‑end, data‑driven products that are stable in production and intuitive for users.
 Current work bridges applied ML with modern web development, emphasizing clean architecture, maintainable code, 
 and accessibility across devices. The goal is to translate complex models into reliable, performant web experiences 
 that solve concrete problems and scale responsibly.
</p>

<p>This approach is shaped by two consistent habits: a systems mindset trained through
 narrative‑heavy gaming—breaking problems into quests, prioritizing objectives, and
 iterating on strategy—and a fitness routine centered on measurable progress and 
 reproducible results. These habits show up in engineering through precise metrics,
 disciplined versioning, and a preference for clarity over cleverness. Projects are 
 scoped with explicit success criteria, tested against real constraints, and delivered 
 with readable documentation and thoughtful UX.
</p>

<p>Recent work includes integrating ML inference into web backends, structuring
 APIs that expose model insights safely, and composing responsive frontends that 
 communicate state clearly under latency and load. Particular interests include 
 model deployment patterns, data quality pipelines, caching and pagination strategies 
 for inference endpoints, and pragmatic performance tuning to keep interactions smooth
 on mid‑range hardware. The result is a product mindset: ship small, measure, learn,
 and iterate.
</p>

<p>Beyond academics, there is active exploration of collaboration opportunities 
 where ML meets full‑stack implementation—internships, research‑oriented builds, 
 or problem‑focused prototypes. Open to roles that value ownership, structured  
 learning, and clear communication. If this aligns with a team’s needs, please
